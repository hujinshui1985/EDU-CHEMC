# EDU-CHEMC
This repository is an official data link of paper "Handwritten Chemical Structure Image to Structure-Specific Markup Using Random Conditional Guided Decoder" in ACM MultiMedia 2023. 

We will release a Handwritten Chemical Structure Image dataset named EDU-CHEMC soon, which consists of totally 52,987 handwritten molecular structure images collected in educational scenarios.

The EDU-CHEMC database is now available to support the competition on ICDAR2024(ICDAR 2024 Competition on Recognition of Chemical Structures). 

Everyone can access the competition site at: https://crocs-ifly-ustc.github.io/crocs/index.html. Once the competition concludes, we will open up the database.
